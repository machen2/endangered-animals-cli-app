# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application => Made a CLI class that gets different levels of input from the user and prints based on that input.
- [x] Pull data from an external source => Made a Scraper class that scrapes data from WWF website.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views => Made first level scrape listing endangered animals based on users choice of conservation status. Then I ask the user which animal they want more details on and scrape further information based on that user input.
